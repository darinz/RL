# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

A comprehensive repository for exploring and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms, environments, and research.

## Status

**This repository is currently under construction.** We are actively developing and organizing the codebase. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we build out the project.

## About Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm for creating autonomous systems that learn to make good decisions through interaction with their environment. It enables agents to discover optimal strategies by learning from experience, making it relevant to an enormous range of applications including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling, and healthcare.

This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning, covering fundamental concepts, core challenges like generalization and exploration, and modern approaches including deep reinforcement learning. Through practical implementations, examples, and detailed documentation, users will gain hands-on experience with key RL techniques and algorithms.



## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of reinforcement learning implementations, research, and educational resources. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented implementations of various RL algorithms along with practical examples and tutorials.

## Planned Features

- **Core RL Algorithms**: Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, A3C, PPO, and more
- **Environment Implementations**: Custom environments for testing and experimentation
- **Research Papers**: Implementation of algorithms from recent RL research
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for understanding RL concepts
- **Benchmarks**: Performance comparisons across different algorithms and environments
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and API references
