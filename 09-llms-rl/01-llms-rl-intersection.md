# 01 - Intersection of LLMs and RL

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two major areas in AI. Their intersection enables advanced applications, such as aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving generative capabilities.

## Why Combine LLMs and RL?
- LLMs generate text, but may not always align with desired behaviors
- RL can optimize LLMs for specific objectives (e.g., helpfulness, safety)

## RL as a Fine-Tuning Tool
- RL is used after supervised pretraining to further optimize LLMs
- Rewards can be based on human feedback, task success, or other criteria

## Example: RL Fine-Tuning Loop (Pseudo-code)

```python
for step in range(num_steps):
    prompt = sample_prompt()
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    reward = compute_reward(response)
    update_llm_with_rl(response, reward)
```

## Summary
- RL enables LLMs to be optimized for objectives beyond next-token prediction
- This intersection is key for advanced AI applications
