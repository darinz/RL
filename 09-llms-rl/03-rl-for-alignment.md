# 03 - RL for Alignment

Alignment ensures that LLMs behave in ways that are safe, ethical, and consistent with human values. RL is a key tool for achieving alignment.

## Reward Modeling for Alignment
- Human feedback is used to train a reward model
- The LLM is optimized to maximize the reward model's output

## Challenges in Alignment
- Defining appropriate reward functions
- Avoiding reward hacking and unintended behaviors
- Ensuring robustness and generalization

## Example: Reward Model Training (Pseudo-code)

```python
for prompt, responses, human_scores in feedback_data:
    reward_model.train_on(prompt, responses, human_scores)
```

## Summary
- RL enables LLMs to be aligned with complex human values
- Ongoing research addresses challenges in reward modeling and safe optimization
