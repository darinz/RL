# 03 - Data-Efficient RL Techniques

Various techniques can improve data efficiency in RL, enabling agents to learn more from less data.

## Common Techniques
- **Model-based RL**: Learn a model of the environment to generate synthetic experience
- **Transfer learning**: Use knowledge from related tasks
- **Reward shaping**: Modify the reward function to guide learning
- **Prioritized experience replay**: Sample important transitions more frequently

## Prioritized Experience Replay

Transitions with higher TD error are sampled more often:

```math
P(i) = \frac{\delta_i^\alpha}{\sum_j \delta_j^\alpha}
```
Where $`\delta_i`$ is the TD error for transition $`i`$ and $`\alpha`$ controls prioritization.

## Example: Prioritized Sampling in Python (Pseudo-code)

```python
# Assume td_errors is a list of TD errors
probs = td_errors ** alpha / np.sum(td_errors ** alpha)
indices = np.random.choice(len(buffer), batch_size, p=probs)
sampled_transitions = [buffer[i] for i in indices]
```

## Summary
- Data-efficient RL is key for practical applications
- Techniques like model-based RL and prioritized replay can greatly improve learning
